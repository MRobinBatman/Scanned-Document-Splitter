# Scanned-Document-Splitter

**Scanned-Document-Splitter** is a Tkinter-based tool designed to simplify the organization and splitting of large PDF files generated from batch document scans. Originally created to handle low-fidelity scanned documents, it efficiently separates them into individual pages and renames each file to match a predefined format for seamless integration into an electronic data management system.

The program solves the specific challenge of processing bulk scans into individual records without manual intervention. While initially built for a particular use case, it has since been expanded to support more general document splitting and renaming needs.

## Features
- Split multi-page PDFs into individual files.
- Automatically rename files according to a customizable naming pattern.
- Supports batch processing for large volumes of documents.
- Flexible enough for general-purpose use beyond the original scenario.
